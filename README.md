# prime_attempt_365datascience: 
related to the 365datascience prime project, this is an attempt, the first commit is incomplete, 

I wouldn't pursue further optimizations because it's no longer fun for me when I proved to myself that I'm able to optimize the whole thing 

I'm not doing this for the fastest whatnot, just a challenge I made for myself, 

I don't feel the need to optimize this imperfect algorithm of mine using bigger sets and multithreading to push it to the limits of itself 
because there's no thrill for me doing that
